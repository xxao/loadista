#  Loadista

*Loadista* is a small utility for convenient upload of custom modules directly into the amazing
[Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) iOS app. Although the app itself lets you upload files already
existing on your iPhone or iPad, you cannot select a whole folder structure. Accessing other device is also
unnecessary complicated. Altogether, uploading a complete modules is somewhat annoying.

All you have to do, is to upload the *loadista.py* into the app's *"Python Modules/site-packages (user)"*
folder and run it from there. In console it shows an address you need to type on another device to get folder listing.
Use the form to upload any file from that device directly into the *"Python Modules/site-packages (user)"* folder.

To upload a whole module with multiple files and folders, just zip it and upload the zipped file. Check the
*Unzip and delete* check box to automatically decompress it after upload.

The *loadista.py* script can be copied to any place inside *Pythonista* to enable upload there.
